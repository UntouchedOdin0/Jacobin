Jacobin provides high performance binary streams reader and writer implementations
located at the {@link me.hugmanrique.jacobin.reader} and {@link me.hugmanrique.jacobin.writer}
packages respectively, as well as bidirectional stream implementations located at the
{@link me.hugmanrique.jacobin.inout} package.<br /><br />Both little-endian and big-endian implementations
are available to ease the reading of larger int types without the cost and complexities associated with using
{@link java.nio.ByteBuffer}.
