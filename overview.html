Jacobin provides high performance binary streams reader and writer implementations
located at the {@link me.hugmanrique.jacobin.reader} and {@link me.hugmanrique.jacobin.writer}
packages respectively, as well as bidirectional stream implementations located at the
{@link me.hugmanrique.jacobin.inout} package.

Both little-endian and big-endian implementations are available to ease the reading of
larger int types without the cost and complexities associated with using {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer}.
